# Dijksta-GUI
It is the GUI file demonstrating the dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.Its is he simple GUI app source code for the simple simulation of Dijkstra's algorithm.You just give the adjacency matrix representation of the Graph and just give the source node, and the destination node and it will give the distance and the path.
